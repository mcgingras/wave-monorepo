# Wave protocol

todo:
- figure out weird caching issues with data fetching...
- make sure delegating is actually clear
- figure out why adding new ideas wasn't working
    - (wave is ending too soon?)
- clean transtion of data after finalizing wave
- make sure supporting waves works out okay + optimistic data
- figure out NFT rendering?
- figure out yield claiming
- add different transaction types (lets just stick to eth transfers for now)
- add server streaming or something else to figure out lag on page transitions between waves
there is a bit of lag when you click arrow to a new page that isn't cached, probably bc the server actions need to fire
we could probably do some streaming
