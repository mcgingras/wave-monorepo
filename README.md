# Wave protocol

todo:
- figure out yield claiming
- add different transaction types (lets just stick to eth transfers for now)
- add server streaming or something else to figure out lag on page transitions between waves
there is a bit of lag when you click arrow to a new page that isn't cached, probably bc the server actions need to fire
we could probably do some streaming
- profile page
